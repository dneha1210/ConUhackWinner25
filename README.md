# MetroMind â€“ A safety net for metro travelers
## Inspiration

Metro incidents are a common challenge faced by urban commuters, leading to delays, stress, and productivity loss. Inspired by the vision of smarter and more reliable public transit, we created MetroMind to leverage AI and data analytics in solving real-world transportation issues. Our goal is to provide commuters with better planning tools and transit operators with actionable insights for improved service reliability.

## What It Does

MetroMind is an AI-powered predictive analytics dashboard that:

- Forecasts metro disruptions in real-time using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model.
- Displays historical metro incident data and trends in an intuitive format.
- Helps commuters make informed decisions about alternate routes or departure times.
- Supports metro management in identifying peak disruption hours and planning resources effectively.
